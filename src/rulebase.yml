ruleset:
- rule: Dangerous driver
  set: Driver d, Vehicle v
  if:
  - d.age < 21
  - v.type == 'fast'
  then:
  - puts 'nah verrily'

#so this is with globals:
- rule: crazy talk
  if:
  - person.is_crazy
  - person.likes_cheese
  then:
  - kill person

- rule: Foo
  set: Driver, Vehicle
  if: driver.age < 21 and vehicle.high_performance
  then: reject application

#ok an idea: how to add convenience methods/wrappers to facts?
#so rules can read more and more plain
#how to store these mappings? in code? in yaml?

vocabulary:
  fact: Driver
  -map: is_crazy = driver.age < 21 and driver.priors > 3
  -field: age, priors, name


#what about more traditional deftemplate type things?
